## Quick Overview

```sh
npx create-html-boilerplate my-app
cd my-app
```

If you've previously installed `create-html-boilerplate` globally via `npm install -g create-html-boilerplate`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-html-boilerplate` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

By using an extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can view the file live at [http://localhost:5500/](http://localhost:5500/)

## Creating an App

**You‚Äôll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-html-boilerplate my-app
```

### npm

### Get Started Immediately

Don't need all the crazy frameworks and tools? Start fresh with a minimal HTML, CSS, and Javascript folder structure.

By running the simple CLI, you can generate a folder structure like so:

```
my-app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js
```
